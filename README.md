# Importance Sampling for Deep Ritz in 1D

This repository contains Python code to apply Importance Sampling (IS) techniques to the Deep Ritz method for solving 1D PDE problems.
It includes implementations of both standard Monte Carlo and IS-based approaches, along with visualization tools for results and variance reduction.

To run the code, install the required dependencies with:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade numpy scipy sympy matplotlib jaxlib jax optax equinox sympy2jax pyevtk lineax
```
